[[CommonCLI][Common CLI Options]]

List option via CLI can be used to get single or multiple instances.  If the instance is not yet materialized but is within the process validity range, WAITING is returned as the state. Instance time is also returned. Log location gives the oozie workflow url
If the instance is in WAITING state, missing dependencies are listed

Example : Suppose a process has 3 instance, one has succeeded,one is in running state and other one is waiting, the expected output is:

{"status":"SUCCEEDED","message":"getStatus is successful","instances":[{"instance":"2012-05-07T05:02Z","status":"SUCCEEDED","logFile":"http://oozie-dashboard-url"},{"instance":"2012-05-07T05:07Z","status":"RUNNING","logFile":"http://oozie-dashboard-url"}, {"instance":"2010-01-02T11:05Z","status":"WAITING"}]}
